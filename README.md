🌿 Beyond Addiction

A Gamified Neural Rewiring & Habit Recovery Suite

📌 Overview

Beyond Addiction is a data-driven habit tracking and recovery platform designed to help users overcome digital addiction and build stronger self-control. Unlike basic reminder apps, this system combines streak tracking, behavioral analytics, and gamification to keep users motivated and consistent.

The goal is simple:
Track. Understand. Improve. Repeat.
