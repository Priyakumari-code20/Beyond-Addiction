<h2>🌿 Beyond Addiction </h2>

A Gamified Neural Rewiring & Habit Recovery Suite

<h2>📌 Overview </h2>

Beyond Addiction is a data-driven habit tracking and recovery platform designed to help users overcome digital addiction and build stronger self-control. Unlike basic reminder apps, this system combines streak tracking, behavioral analytics, and gamification to keep users motivated and consistent.

Track. Understand. Improve. Repeat.
